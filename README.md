Drag and Drop Interface

This is a simple web page that allows users to drag and drop items between two containers. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase front-end development skills, specifically implementing a drag and drop functionality.

Features
Drag and drop functionality implemented using HTML5 Drag and Drop API.
Two containers (div elements) are provided side by side on the page.
The first container is populated with a list of items.
Users can drag items from the first container and drop them into the second container.
Visual feedback is provided during dragging by changing the appearance of the dragged item.
When an item is dropped into the second container, a success message is displayed, and the UI is appropriately updated.
A reset button is provided to clear the second container and reset the first container to its original state.
